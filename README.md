### Notes

The challenge I faced was finding the one mistake that was "breaking" my code. When I was implementing the tab bar controller and trying to run the app, it showed a blank screen. For the longest I did not know what I did wrong, but the solution was to move the Storyboard Entry Point Arrow. It was that simple. I forget that I need to let myself make these mistakes!

### Notes
The challenges I faced when working on this assignment was understanding why the syntax is the way it is. As I was watching the assignment videos, I find myself wanting to understand what I didn't need to "worry" for now.
